# SilDactyl54

SilDactyl54 is a RP2040 Zero based 54-key split keyboard. It has no PCBs and requires no 3d print. It is very cheap and extremely configurable at the same time. It uses hotswap sockets, has a thumb cluster and supports vial.

Before proceeding read the [apiaster](https://github.com/nmunnich/apiaster) guide (the best guide in the internet) - do not order anything yet.

Most probably you can get it to work with choc switches and wireless MCU. Since I have not tried that, so this guide is only for MX switches with RP2040-Zero.

The project is forked from https://squalius-cephalus.github.io/silakka54 and reuses 90% of the original silakka54 firmware.
