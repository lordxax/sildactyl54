# SilDactyl54

SilDactyl54 is a RP2040 Zero based 54-key split keyboard. It has no PCBs and requires no 3d print. It is very cheap and extremely configurable. It can be row staggered, column staggered or dactyl or some mixture of them (dactyl with column stagger). It uses hotswap sockets, has a configurable thumb cluster and supports vial.

Before proceeding it is recommended to read the
- [apiaster](https://github.com/nmunnich/apiaster) guide (the best guide in the internet) - do not order anything yet.
- some dactyl manuform guides ( like this one https://sachee.medium.com/building-my-first-keyboard-and-you-can-too-512c0f8a4c5f or https://medium.com/swlh/complete-idiot-guide-for-building-a-dactyl-manuform-keyboard-53454845b065 )

Most probably you can get it to work with choc switches and wireless MCU. Since I have not tried that, this guide is only for MX switches with RP2040-Zero.

The project is forked from https://squalius-cephalus.github.io/silakka54 and reuses 90% of the original silakka54 firmware.

> [!WARNING]
> read entire guide before ordering anything. The end product is not beautiful, unless you have some good crafting skills.
