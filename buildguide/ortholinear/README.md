### Bill of materials
- **54x** MX compatible key switches or 45 if you want to go super chameap

- wire (I already had it)
- heat shrink tubbing (the one I bought had a lot of big size tubbings that are not needed for this build)
- one of below 
   - **2x** PJ320D audio sockets + **1x** TRRS audio cable ( TRRS is not the best idea as it introduced the risk to short your MCU )
   - 1x USB male to female cable (I used this one eventually as I forgot to order TRRS cable)
   - 1xUSB cable and 2 USB connectors
   - any 4 wire cable with connectors
