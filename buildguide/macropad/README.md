# 3x3 or 4x4 Macropad Keyboard Build Guide

Total cost is below 15$ (when using AliExpress bundle deals) and you will already have a lot of parts for the full build.

The entire result from this guide can be reused/extended into a full keyboard (of any size). I recommend to go with the same size as our tester is. The firmware is for 4x4 but it will work with 3x3 as well.

The end product is not a finished/ready-to-use keyboard. It is missing a bottom case. I've never intended to actually use it, but it should be fairly easy to add it. 

## Bill of materials
links to most of them can be foind here https://github.com/nmunnich/apiaster/blob/main/docs/mx-ordering-guide/mx-zero.md

- wire (I already had it)
- heat shrink tubbing (the one I bought had a lot of big size tubbings that are not needed for this build)
