# 3x3 or 4x4 Macropad Keyboard Build Guide

Total cost is below 15$ (when using AliExpress bundle deals) and you will already have a lot of parts for the full build.

The entire result from this guide can be reused/extended into a full keyboard (of any size).

## Bill of materials
links to most of them can be foind here https://github.com/nmunnich/apiaster/blob/main/docs/mx-ordering-guide/mx-zero.md  
- **1x** 3x3 or 4x4 MX switch tester (e.g. https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ey9GKVk for 5$)
- **16x** Kailh Hotswap Sockets (it is better to buy 54+ from the start: e.g. 70 here https://a.aliexpress.com/_EI1RGyw )
- **16x** 1N4148 Diodes (again buy 54+ e.g. 100 here https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuIykz4)
- **16x** keycaps (you can buy entire set for 3$ https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQTRqyi )
- **1x** RP2040 Zero (e.g. choose welded https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGZg0Cw )
- wire (I already had it)
- heat shrink tubbing (the one I bought had a lot of big size tubbings that are not needed for this build)

## Tools
- check out https://github.com/nmunnich/apiaster/blob/main/docs/mx-ordering-guide/mx-zero.md#tools for more details
- my tools
  - multimeter is going to make this build way easier (I alreafy had one)
  - my soldering kit for 7$: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwCditk
  - you also need some good solder. The solder from that set was bad
