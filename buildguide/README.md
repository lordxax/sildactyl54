## Tools for all builds
- check out https://github.com/nmunnich/apiaster/blob/main/docs/mx-ordering-guide/mx-zero.md#tools for more details
- My tools
  - multimeter is going to make this build way easier (I alreafy had one)
  - my soldering kit for 7$: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwCditk
  - you also need some good solder. The solder from that set was bad

## Switch choice
If ou don't know which switches are for you I highly recommend going through the Macropad build or at least ordering the switch tester. Building macropad will also help if you are new to soldering, QMK or you want to check if this is going to work. For me this was my first soldering and first QMK keyboard.

Outemu silent lemon v3 are cheap, silent and fit well in the tester base. I've also ordered Akko Dracula (I like them more), but they were too small for the acrylic tester base (so I've put them in my silakka54 keyboard). From all the switches I've received around half of them are too small and cannot be attached firmly in the tester base. This is another argument to order the switch tester before getting too many switches if particular type.

If you want to go super cheap you can order 45 switches and reuse aome of the swotches from the tester for thumb cluster or some rarely used buttons (e.g. the top row)
